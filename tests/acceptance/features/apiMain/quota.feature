	# Owner

	Scenario: Uploading a file as owner having enough quota
		Given using new DAV path

		And the quota of user "user0" has been set to "10 MB"
		When user "user0" uploads file "data/textfile.txt" to "/testquota.txt" with all mechanisms using the API
		Then the HTTP status code of all upload responses should be "201"
